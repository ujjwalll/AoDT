## AoDT (Analysis of Developmental Trees)  

More information about various analytical techniques used to analyze developmental (lineage and differentiation) trees:

* Information isometry and isometric spaces (refer [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/062539v2)).  

* Differentiation maps (refer [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/14/282004)).  

Open Datasets:

* Dataset for lineage and differentiation codes, _C. elegans_ developmental cell lineage.   [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/blob/master/lineage-and-differentiation-codes.csv)

* Randomized trees based on _C. elegans_ developmental cell lineage that generates differentiation codes.   [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/blob/master/randomized-trees-by-diff-code.csv)
